## Remarks
- Clean project and architecture :fire:
- No useless branch :fire:
- I really like the group of property per average price by property_type per state of the building chart
- Nice to display per sub_type of property to show the granularity of the data (the kot exception is a nice insight)
- interesting strategy for number_of_facade
- "not specified" is not a good way to populate a dataset, prefer None or NaN 
- main.py is a bit messy, no typing, no docstring, no comments, no OOP,... but notebooks are well structured
- good outliers management :thumsup:
- That's good work! :fire:
