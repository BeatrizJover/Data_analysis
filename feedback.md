### Step 3: Data Interpretation

- Plot the outliers.
- Which variables would you delete and why ?
- Represent the number of properties according to their surface using a histogram.
- In your opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)


## Plots Must-Have

- A descriptive title.
- Legends where appropriate.
- Properly labeled axes, including units.
- Thoughtful use of colors.
- Comparable scales when comparing data.
- Avoid overlapping text to improve readability.



## Remarks
- Clean project and architecture :fire:
- No useless branch :fire:
- I really like the group of property per average price by property_type per state of the building chart
- Nice to display per sub_type of property to show the granularity of the data (the kot exception is a nice insight)
- interesting strategy for number_of_facade
- "not specified" is not a good way to populate a dataset, prefer None or NaN 
- main.py is a bit messy, no typing, no docstring, no comments, no OOP,... but notebooks are well structured
- good outliers management :thumsup:
- That's good work! :fire:
